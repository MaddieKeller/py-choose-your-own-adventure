# py-choose-your-own-adventure
A choose-your-own adventure game written in Python 2.7.1

The game is based on the old choose-your-own adventure books that I used to read as kids (and which are finding a resurgence with the ebook revolution.) 

The game is set in the world of dungeons and dragons, which is filled with various races, magic, and other wonders.

At startup the game will ask you to create a character. The character's class and race play an important part in the game and make a difference on the options you will be given during the course of the game.
